<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
<p>The purpose of CiteSet is to capture project-related information. My goal was to simplify 
the wonderful ideas of projects like <a href="http://chandlerproject.org">Chandler</a>, 
<a href="http://delicious.com">Delicious</a>, and 
<a href="http://rednotebook.sourceforge.net">RedNotebook</a>. For example, I wanted a place 
to store information about software projects that I had started. I might have source files, 
journal entries, Internet resources and links. All of this information needed to be culled 
into a single spot where I could easily manage my musings. 
</p>
<p>At the same time, CiteSet represents what I think is the simplest possible solution that 
can work for an archetypal kind of modern application: the application must be composed 
of independent parts, and it must have various well-known layers (data for persistence, 
service for supporting various user interface designs, and application for managing 
service lifecycle). 
</p>

<h1>GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS</h1>
<p>Generally speaking, CiteSet is config-driven so things like database connection strings 
and RESTful service endpoints are defined in the configuration files. Additionally, each 
component uses the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648951.aspx">Microsoft Enterpise Libary</a>
to inject new instances at runtime which means that logging can be selectively enabled in the 
configuration files. Finally, the service endpoints are supported by a configuration extention 
that defines a Factory class. This means that new Factory implementations can be added 
later, as needed.
</p>
<h1>DATA LAYER</h1>
<p>In my case, I don't need robust persistence and I prefer working with plain-old objects 
when the data has little chance of being aggregated, so I chose to use 
<a href="http://www.db4o.com/">Db4o</a> (ask me about my 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.security.membershipprovider.aspx">MembershipProvider</a>
implementation for Db4o sometime!). The Db4o logic is straightforward, the API is clean, 
and the file structure doesn't have the complexity of other object stores 
like <a href="http://ravendb.net">RavenDB</a>.
</p>

<h1>SERVICE LAYER</h1>
<p>The service layer is RESTful for the sake of simplicity. Similar to the choice of Db4o, 
RESTful services are expected to subscribe to well-known paradigms which make them easy 
for developers to leverage. In this case, I chose to expose two endpoints: 
1) projects and 2) resources. Projects represent the highest level container for 
project-related data and information. Resources represent files and links that are 
associated with a project either directly or tangentally. These two entities seemed 
like the most obvious to be manipulated, and I had plans to build in some batch import 
features, so for now these are the two exposed endpoints. The addressability relies on 
GUIDs which is ugly, but gets the job done.
</p>
<p>The most novel element of the service layer, and the beginning of the batch 
processing that I want, is the PageAdapter and ResourceBridge which will work together to 
read the link and meta tags from a web page and add them to the data store. This basically 
saves me from adding tags everytime I add a web reference to a project. True, I might 
end up with some SEO garbage, but I think it's better to remove the metadata I don't need 
than to slow down the process of adding.
</p>

<h1>APPLICATION LAYER</h1>
<p>Finally, the application layer manages the lifecycle of the database and service 
endpoints. Ideally, the RESTful service would be accessed by multiple clients, so a 
Windows service made the most sense as host. Besides, I didn't want users to have to 
install a web server; so CiteSet is as self-contained and minimalistic as it can possibly be.
</p>
<img src="images/CiteSet_Static_Application_Layer.png" alt="CiteSet_Static_Application_Layer.png" />
<h1>INSTALLATION</h1>
<p>To install the application, unzip the release package to the directory of your choice. 
The release package contains:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A console application for temporary deployments or developing,</li>
<li>A Windows service application for long-running deployments,</li>
<li>Batch files for installing and uninstalling the Windows service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each application has its own configuration file. The &lt;connectionStrings&gt; section 
contains a single connection string for the database service. The format conforms to 
the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.uri.aspx">Uri class</a>, but it 
is essentially a file path; the value of the AbsolutePath represents a directory 
rooted at <code>C:\</code>. The default location is in the root, but could be changed 
to something like <code>/Users/&lt;someuser_name&gt;/AppData/Local</code>, if desired.
</p>
<p>Both the database and service endpoints have port numbers that might be blocked by 
the local firewall, so it might be necessary to allow these ports to transmit data.
